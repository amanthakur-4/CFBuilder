# CFBuilder

The Construction File Builder is designed to help people format their construction files properly. In the current version, CFBuilder supports basic construction file formatting but will soon expand to provide functionality for things like Golden Gate reactions and Ortholog Scan experiments. 

## Tutorial
The first input field allows the user to name the text file which will be downloaded. Enter the name you would like for your construction file here.

The next input box is for entering any manipulation steps you would to be included with the construction file. By default this is a PCR step, but this step can be deleted by pressing the red 'X' on the right side of the input box. To add a different step, simply press one of the blue button directly below.

For proper formatting, enter the name of the step on the left side of the input field and anything that you would like to be included in the parentheses on the right side of ther input field:

Next, enter the oligos that you will be using in the "Oligo" field. 
The name of the oligo goes in the left side of the input field and the sequence of the oligo goes in the right side of the input field:

Finally, add the names and sequences of any plasmids that you would like to add in the "Plasmid Template" Field:

Once you are done, press the green "Create Construction File" button. A .txt file should begin downloading.


## Enjoy your construction file!

*Developer notes: This is an ongoing project. There will be updates to address any issues that may come up such as nomenclature inaccuracies, bugs, and user interface improvement. I am also planning on updating the site with more features in the near future. Thanks! -- Aman*
